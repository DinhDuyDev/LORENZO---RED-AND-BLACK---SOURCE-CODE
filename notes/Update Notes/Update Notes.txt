27.02.2024 LOG:
	- Changed enemy alert value from 46 to 48
	- Added a condition for the enemy: if visible, then could do things
		+ Added a condition: if the enemy is visible, then do damage, if not then no damage is done
	- Added a mission controller, a state machine for said controller and text boxes to show things
	- Added a dialogue index. If this dialogue index goes down to zero, the mission will begin.

28.02.2024 - 26.03.2024:
	- Changed the story (from a remake of 1932's Scarface to a completely original story).
	- Drafted a new story.
	- Playtested multiple times (useless anyway).
	
27.03.2024 LOG:
	- Finished the story for Act One.
	- Added / drew a cutscene for the first chapter.
	- Added new graphics.
	
28.03.2024 LOG:
	- Added a new scene showing the aftermath of the shootout.
	- Added two enemies to the first shootout to increase intensity.
	- Revived hope for the game because it is so difficult.

29.03.2024 LOG:
	- Relocated the two new enemies to the central room in the first shootout.
	- Reverse this change above - that makes the game too easy.
	- Added two components to player and enemy animations: leg and torso:
		+ Leg shows leg movement.
		+ Torso shows gun aiming.
		+ System was inspired by Wolfenstein
	
30.03.24 LOG:
	- Added GUINO as an enemy for the player.
	- GUINO will actually move because Vince accidentally closes the door too hard.
	- Changed enemy torso animation -> they looked like they were holding autocannons.
	- Fixed the issue where bullet dents (which are actual objects) would overlay the sprites of the enemies.
		+ However, still need to fix the issue where bullet dents overlay the CORPSES of different NPCs.
	- Need to add more cutscenes.

31.03.2024 LOG:
	- Added cutscene switching and progression.
	- Plan to do one cutscene a day.
	- Plan to finish the first level by Wednesday next week.
	
02.04.2024 LOG:
	- Added a new style of color and lighting to the cutscenes:
		+ Now lighting is done in the form of dithering.
		+ The color palette is restricted to 3 colors only.
	- Lost a ton of motivation, but will still keep fighting!
		+ NEVER GIVE UP ON THE SUITS GANG!
		
09.04.2024 LOG:
	- Reworked the first level.
	- Aded new enemy AI behaviors: ambush mode, idle mode and roam mode. These are implemented as different properties.
		+ Ambush: enemies look at one direction and stays still.
		+ Idle: enemies stay still but look around.
		+ Roam: enemies search for you and look around.
	- Fixed the issues of bulletholes not appearing properly.
	- Changed Lupara's spread from 9 to 32 (damn)
	- Changed Shotgun's spread from 9 to 12.5.
	- Changed Tommygun damage from 10 to 15.
	- Added limits to where enemies could go under a form of an object.
	
11.04.2024 LOG:
	- Tried to add new mechanics / levels (the Fine Rose Diner level went through 2 iterations, both failed due to being too boring).
	- Tried to add a FOG mechanic, however didn't work too well + unsuitable with the kind of game I'm playing.
	- Changed hitbox hitscan detection to point hitscan detection:
		+ Used hitboxes of the PLAYER THEMSELF (absolutely dumb) to calculate for hitscan. This meant that
			bullets can collide with walls even when they shouldn't.
		+ Changed to point hit detection, which was much more clever (because the bullets are small).
		+ This also means that enemies are more lethal as their shots could go through small gaps. 
		
12.04.2024 LOG:
	- Changed the movement of the player: from walking 8 pixels at a time every 15 tics (out of 60 tics)
	to walking every 5 tics. Also changed the way I write logs :)
	- Changed the movement of the enemy to match the player's movement.
	- Created a new level for the docks: Paulie.
	- Added crates that can dynamically orient themselves.
	- Added a gun sprite onto the crates to signify that these are gun crates.
	- Added a "marking feature": this is to mark the important characters that come in the form of enemies.
		+ A choice called "mark" will be on the character editing menu: toggling this will cause a purple / fuchsia 
			square to appear on the enemy's head.

13.04.2024 LOG:
	- Added a dynamically rotating truck.
	- Added two new levels for chapter 3.
	- Tried adding reloading to the enemies, but failed.  
	
14.04.2024 LOG:
	- Added new precise collision settings for boxes and trucks.
	- Updated the truck sprite.
	- Reduced sawed-off spread from 32 to 18.

	- Thought of adding a car riding feature (drive by shooting)

	- Made the enemy slightly more aggressive when they are alerted (their field of view expands)
	- Added new character sprites for the holdings of different guns.
	- Added a feature where enemies stop screaming after dying (a bug that caused enemies to keep yelling after dying).

		+ Drivable vehicle.
		+ The font.
